							<h2>Assignment 2A: One scatter plot and two datasets</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The following is a scatter plot of the amount of prostitution crimes related to the amount of vehicle theft crimes in the different police districts in San Fransisco. <br/>
							The scatter plot is available in two versions - one from 2003 and one from 2015. You can switch between the two by clicking the button below the plot as well as toggle labels for each individual point. <br/>
							The size of the points in the scatter plot is determined by the total amount of crime (ie. including all other categories) in the given district. <br/>
							This can be seen by hovering the mouse over the data points, where the total amount of crimes pop up. <br/>
							The axes have not been scaled on purpose. This ensures that the two years are directly comparable in terms of the difference. Thus it's very easy to see that eg. the amount of prostitution crimes has dropped quite a bit in the span of the years.
